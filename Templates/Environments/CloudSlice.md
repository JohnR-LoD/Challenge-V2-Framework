<summary title="Select to expand">Understanding a Cloud Slice</summary>
- Your Challenge Lab is using a cloud slice that reflects a dynamic, constantly evolving cloud environment. A cloud slice is a subset of a cloud platform subscription that has been assigned to a user account which was provisioned for you to use for the duration of this Challenge Lab. It provides temporary access to a subset of resources available in a cloud subscription so that you can learn the concepts without having to configure your own subscription. A cloud slice has restrictions on the types of administrative activities that are allowed. 

- As you complete your Challenge Lab, you may find that the provided guidance is not identical to what you encounter in your cloud slice environment. If you encounter a difference between your cloud slice and the Challenge Lab instructions, please let us know by submitting feedback directly to Challenge Lab Feedback so that we may update the content in as timely a manner as possible.
